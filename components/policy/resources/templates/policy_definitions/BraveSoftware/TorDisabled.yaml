  Disable Tor connectivity in Brave.

  Using Tor connectivity in Private Windows makes it more difficult for sites to see a user's true IP address and for network observers to see what sites they visit. This may be used for enhanced confidentiality and censorship resistance in Private Windows.

            If this policy is set to true, Tor connectivity will always be disabled.

            If this policy is set to false, Tor connectivity will be enabled if the user opens a Private Window with Tor.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, Tor connectivity will be enabled if the user opens a Private Window with Tor.
