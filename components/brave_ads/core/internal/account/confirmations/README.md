# Confirmations

Confirmations are part of the Brave Ads advertising model, which is designed to respect user privacy while also rewarding Brave Rewards users for their attention.

These anonymous requests enable Brave to generate aggregate statistics, allowing advertisers to evaluate the performance of their campaigns in terms of total impressions, click-through rates, and conversion rates.

See [confirmation redemption](../utility/redeem_confirmation/README.md).

Please add to it!
